# Meow Token

Meow ($MEOW) is a silly meme token deploying on the [Linea](https://linea.build/) blockchain.

This repo contains the Meow token contract implementation. The contract is a standard ERC20 token using the [Solmate ERC20 implementation](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC20.sol) contracts.

The Meow token contract can be found in [src/MeowToken.sol](https://github.com/MeowToken/MeowERC20/blob/main/src/MeowToken.sol). It implements the [Solmate ERC20](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC20.sol) contract without any modifications.


## Deployments
Meow token has not been deployed to the Linea network yet. This is just a meme token code for entertainment purposes.

Please do not actually use this token in any serious way! It has no utility and is just for fun.
